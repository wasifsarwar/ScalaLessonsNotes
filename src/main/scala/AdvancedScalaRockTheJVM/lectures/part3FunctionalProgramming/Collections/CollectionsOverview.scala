  * - mutable collections can be updated in place; immutables can never change
  * - Scala standard library has type definitions/type aliases for immutable collections

/** Immutable collections are found in scala.collections.immutable
  * The head abstract class is Traversable, which is extended by Iterable
  * Iterable is extended by Set: HashSet & SortedSet, Seq, Map: HashMap and SortedMap
  * Seq is a type of collection that can be traversed in a set order
  * e.g Indexed Seq and LinearSeq
